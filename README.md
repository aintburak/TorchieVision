## :grey_question: Project Overview

TorchieVision is a project aimed at providing a comprehensive solution for computer vision tasks using PyTorch. With a focus on simplicity and effectiveness, this project offers a range of functionalities to facilitate the development and deployment of computer vision models.

Key features of TorchieVision include:
- Simplified data loading and preprocessing for image datasets.
- Implementation of common computer vision models using PyTorch.
- Training, evaluation, and inference pipelines for seamless model development.
- Integration with popular datasets such as CIFAR10, ImageNet, and MNIST.
- Extensive documentation and example usage to support users at every stage of their computer vision projects.

Whether you're a beginner exploring computer vision concepts or an experienced practitioner developing advanced models, TorchieVision aims to be your go-to resource for all things related to computer vision with PyTorch.


## üìä What about data?

When dealing with image, text, audio, or video data, standard Python packages that load data into a numpy array are often used. These arrays can then be converted into `torch.*Tensor`.

- For images, packages such as Pillow and OpenCV are useful.
- For audio, packages such as scipy and librosa are commonly used.
- For text, options include raw Python or Cython-based loading, as well as NLTK and SpaCy.

For vision tasks specifically, the `torchvision` package provides data loaders for common datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR10, and MNIST, along with data transformers for images (`torchvision.datasets` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`). This package offers significant convenience and helps avoid writing boilerplate code.

For this project, you can use the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of the following classes: 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, representing 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels.


The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Loading**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and preprocessed using PyTorch's torchvision library.
2. **Model Definition**: A CNN model is defined using PyTorch's nn.Module API.
3. **Training**: The model is trained on the training dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization and cross-entropy loss.
4. **Testing**: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its performance.
5. **Model Saving and Loading**: The trained model is saved to disk and can be loaded for future use.

## üöÄ File Structure


The project directory structure is organized as follows:

```
TorchieVision/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyTorchProject/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/ # Directory to store dataset files (automatically generated)
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py # Main Python script containing the PyTorch CNN project code
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cifar_net.pth # Trained model file (automatically generated after training)
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md # Project documentation file
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt # File containing project dependencies

```


In this structure:

- `data/`: This directory is automatically generated to store dataset files used in the project.
- `main.py`: This file contains the main Python script that implements the PyTorch CNN project.
- `cifar_net.pth`: This file is automatically generated after training and contains the trained model.
- `README.md`: This file serves as the project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: This file contains a list of project dependencies required to run the code.
